Problem

Cody-Jamal has heard about generative artificial intelligence producing art. He is excited about the new art opportunities, but also worried about human-created art being displaced. He thought a good compromise would be to use computers to create art that humans simply cannot.

Since Cody-Jamal is just beginning at computer-generated art, he started simple. He wants to create an immense string that shows the English alphabet in a doubly-repeated way, to represent its ubiquity and permanence.

Cody-Jamal wrote the following program:

for i = 1 to 1e100:
  for letter = A to Z:
    print letter i times
Here 1e100 represents the integer 10100
. For example:

When i=1
, the program prints ABCD....XYZ.
When i=2
, the program prints AABBCC...XXYYZZ.
When i=3
, the program prints AAABBBCCC...XXXYYYZZZ.
Of course, Cody-Jamal's program takes a long time to finish. Can you help him know what the N
-th printed letter will be without waiting for it to be printed?



Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T
. T
 test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line with an integer N
.


Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x
: y
, where x
 is the test case number (starting from 1) and y
 is the N
-th character printed by Cody-Jamal's program.


Limits

Time limit: 20 seconds.
Memory limit: 2 GB.
1≤T≤100

Test Set 1 (Visible Verdict)
1≤N≤106

Test Set 2 (Visible Verdict)
1≤N≤1012
.


Sample Input
2
5
31

Sample Output
Case #1: E
Case #2: CThe first 35
 letters printed by Cody-Jamal's program are ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZAABBCCDDE.... Therefore, the 5
th printed character is E and the 31
st is C.
